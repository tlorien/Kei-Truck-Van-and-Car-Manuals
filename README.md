## About This Project

Kei vehicles, known for their compact size and efficiency, are popular in Japan and are gaining interest worldwide. However, access to their manuals, which are primarily only available in Japanese, limits their usability and ability to perform maintenance by non-Japanese speakers. This project aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized, translated repository of Kei vehicle manuals.

### Objectives

- **Comprehensive Manual Coverage**: From trucks and vans to cars, all Kei vehicle types are welcome.
- **Community-Driven Translations**: Leveraging the power of open source to gather and translate manuals into multiple languages.
- **Easy Navigation**: Intuitively structured manuals by make, model, and year for ease of use.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that all content is accessible, free, and easy to access.
