## 2-1. Engine

### A. Engine Cooling System

#### 1. Overview
- A thermistor for controlling the interior fan has been added to all naturally aspirated vehicles. (Already installed on SC vehicles)
- By changing the interior fan operation system, the quality of the interior fan control after the engine is turned off has been improved. (All naturally aspirated vehicles) (Even after the engine is turned off, the interior fan may continue to rotate and make an operating noise depending on the conditions.)

#### 2. Structure and Operation
Conventional vehicles (naturally aspirated vehicles): Timer-activated (operates for up to 15 minutes even after engine is turned off if water temperature is 96°C or above or intake air temperature is 53°C or above)

New vehicles (all vehicles): Fan operates only when temperature rises based on interior temperature sensing
